[Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/) empowers companies to capture and act on customer, product, brand & employee experience insights in one place.

mParticle will forward data to [Qualtrics' JSON Event](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/actions-module/json-events/). 

## Enable the Integration

1. Per Qualtrics' [supported authentication types](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/actions-module/json-events/#AuthSupported), follow the steps for "HTTP Basic Auth" to generate your Authorization Header. 
2. In your Qualtrics account, follow the steps to [set up a JSON Event](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/actions-module/json-events/#SettingUp). As part of this process you will be given a URL to invoke your new Qualtrics workflow.
3. With your Authorization Header and Workflow URL, configure the Qualtrics Event Integration via mParticle's integrations directory.
4. In Qualtrics, continue with the setup steps for a JSON Event. You can manually define the event's format using "Advanced Setup" or follow the steps for [Capturing Events](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/actions-module/json-events/#CaptureTestEvent) to parse a sample event from mParticle. Depending on the mParticle event types you forward to Qualtrics, you may need to define multiple Qualtrics Workflows with corresponding mParticle Webhook outputs.
