This integration supports forwarding commerce events to Facebook's Offline Conversions API.

**Note:** This integration is intended _only_ to forward commerce events occurring outside of your app, which have been uploaded to mParticle via a custom feed. Data from your app platforms should be forwarded to Facebook via the main [Facebook event integration](/integrations/facebook/event/).

## Prerequisites

To use this feed you must be receiving commerce events from an "unbound" feed that you want to forward to Facebook. Learn more about unbound vs. "act-as" feeds [here](/guides/feeds/#forwarding-data-from-feeds).

Follow [Facebook's instructions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/offline-conversions/v3.2) to:
* add Facebook Business Manager.
* create an App ID.
* obtain an access token with `ads_management` access.
* and create an Offline Event Set.

## Data mapping

### Event names

mParticle maps Commerce events to Facebook's Offline Conversion Events according to the product action, as follows:

| mParticle product action | Facebook `event_name` value |
|  ----------------------  | --------------------- |
| Add to Cart | `"AddToCart"` |
| Add to Wishlist | `"AddToWishList"` |
| Checkout | `"Checkout"` |
| Purchase | `"Purchase"` |
| View Detail | `"ViewContent"` |

### Match keys

Events are matched to Facebook users via [match keys](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/offline-conversions/v3.2#match-keys), forwarded to Facebook as hashed values. Hashes of the following identities are used as match keys, if available:

* Email
* Apple Advertising ID
* Google Advertising ID

Hashes of the following [reserved user attributes](/developers/server/json-reference/#user_attributes) are also forwarded as match keys if present:

* Gender
* First Name
* Last Name
* City
* Country

### Other attributes

| Facebook Attribute | mParticle mapping |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| `event_time` | `event.data.timestamp_unixtime_ms` |
| `contents` | Derived from the event's `products` array |
| `value` | `event.data.product_action.total_amount`, if set. Otherwise, calculated by summing the price of all products in the `products` array. |
| `custom_data` | A JSON dictionary of any custom attributes of the event. |

## Configuration Settings

| Setting Name| Data Type | Default Value | Description |

| Email Type      | `enum`      | Email | Required. The mParticle User Identity type to forward as an Email to Facebook. The email user identity will be hashed before forwarding to Facebook, other user identities selected from this dropdown will not be hashed prior to forwarding.                                                                      |
