Google Cloud Storage provides a file storage web service for developers and enterprises that combines the performance and scalability of Googleâ€™s cloud with geo-redundancy, advanced security and sharing capabilities.

## Supported Features

* Event Forwarding

## Prerequisites

To activate your Google Cloud Storage integration, you will need an active Google Service Account. 

Create a Bucket in your account to store your mParticle data and grant `Storage Object Creator` to `mparticle-gcp-clientfacing@gcp-prod-170221.iam.gserviceaccount.com`. This allows mParticle to create files in your bucket.

Optionally, you can create a folder in your bucket to store your mParticle data. This is useful if you are storing other data in the same bucket, or if you want to separate dev and production data without creating two buckets. If you want to store your data in a folder, you must provide the name of the folder in the Connection Settings dialog.

## Data Processing Notes

Google Cloud Storage accepts data from all platform types. All event types are supported. By default all available data will be forwarded, but you can pick and choose which events and attributes to send in the Connection Settings dialog.


## Connection Settings

| Setting Name | Data Type | Default Value | Platform | Description |
| ---|---|---|---|--- |
| Storage Bucket Name | `string` | <unset> | All| The name of the storage bucket to which mParticle will forward event data. |
| Folder Name | `string` | <unset> | All| An optional name of a folder in the storage bucket in which to store event data. |
| Unique ID | `string` | <unset> | All| An optional string identifier for your app that will be forwarded with each event batch.  Standard app identifiers (Apple OS Bundle ID, Android Package Name) will be forwarded regardless of this setting. |
| Store Data In Folders By Date | `string` | UNSELECTED | All | If enabled, your data will be stored in a cloud folder according to the chosen method. |  
| Metadata Field Exclusion | `Custom Field` |  | All | A way to exclude specific fields of metadata properties (Device Name or IP Address) in the output. |
| Send Lifecycle Events | `bool` | True | All| If enabled, lifecycle events (application start/stop, session start/end) will be forwarded. |
