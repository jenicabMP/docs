## Overview & Prerequisites

Indicative supports both Event and Audience connections when integrating with an mParticle data source. In general, Indicative requires an event input to be able to use the platform, so enabling the Event connection is required.

You will need an Indicative API key to activate your Indicative integration with mParticle. You can find this in your Indicative [project settings](https://app.indicative.com/#/settings/organization/projects).
