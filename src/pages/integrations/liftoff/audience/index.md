Liftoff is a full-service mobile app marketing and retargeting platform that uses post-install data to run true CPA-optimized user acquisition and retention campaigns.

## Prerequisites 

* In order to enable our integration with Liftoff, you'll need to work with your Liftoff account executive to obtain your Liftoff App ID and API Key.
* Prior to enabling an audience connection for [user attribute sharing](/guides/platform-guide/audiences/real-time/#user-attribute-sharing), you must share the user attribute names with your Liftoff Account Manager so they can be setup for use in Liftoff models.
