## How to connect an output

1. Go to the [Directory](https://app.mparticle.com/directory) page and search for the integration you'd like to connect. 
2. Hover over the tile with the integration name, and then click **Setup**.
3. Choosse an integration type from the types presented, such as **Event**.
4. Click **Go to Setup**.
5. In the Setup/Outputs page, find your integration name and open it.
6. In the Output: Event Configuration page, add a descriptive configuration name and the output service's API key or other token as indicated to make the connection.
7. Click **Save**.

If an integration output has already been added, you can skip steps 1-4 and instead, navigate to **Setup > Outputs**, and continue with step 5.
