title: Custom Access Roles API
---

The Custom Access Roles API allows account admins to create, modify, and delete lists of specific permissions (custom roles) that can be assigned to users through the mParticle UI. Custom roles are helpful for mParticle accounts with multiple users who don't need the same degree of access or when an admin needs to prevent a user from accessing a specific feature.

For example, there are only a few features a marketer would need to access, such as Audiences, Calculated Attributes, and the User Activity View.  By creating a custom role for marketers, you can remove their access to features that are beyond the scope of their job, such as API Credentials, Data Planning, or Filters. Compared to generic user roles, the Custom Access Roles API gives you granular control so you can create roles that best fit each member of your team.

<aside class="warning">
    Custom Access Roles is a closed beta feature. If you are interested in participating in the closed beta, contact your account manager to gain access.
</aside>

## Endpoint

The Custom Access Roles API is located at `https://api.mparticle.com`.

## Authentication

<aside>
    Only Custom Role Admins can create API credentials to access the Custom Access Roles API. A current Custom Role Admin can grant this permission in User Management, or you can contact your mParticle account manager to have this permission provisioned for select admins.
</aside>

To use the Custom Access Roles API, you must first create a new set of API credentials that includes access to this API:

1. Log in to your mParticle account.

2. Click the **User Profile** icon at the bottom of the left nav bar, click **Settings**, and select the API Credentials tab.

3. Click **+ Add Credential**.

4. Enter a descriptive name for the Display name.

5. Check the box next to Custom Roles, and click **Save**.

6. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** displayed in the modal window before clicking **Done**.

### Create a new bearer token

After creating the new API credentials for the Custom Roles API, you can authenticate by issuing a `POST` request to mParticle's SSO token endpoint:

`https://sso.auth.mparticle.com/oauth/token`

The JSON body of the request must contain:

* `client_id` - the client ID, issued by mParticle when creating the API credentials
* `client_secret` - the client secret, issued by mParticle when creating the API credentials
* `audience` - set to a value of `"https://api.mparticle.com"`
* `grant_type` - set to a value of `"client_credentials"`

#### Example curl request

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://sso.auth.mparticle.com/oauth/token \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"client_id":"...","client_secret":"...","audience":"https://api.mparticle.com","grant_type":"client_credentials"}'
```

#### Example HTTP request
```http
POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1
Host: sso.auth.mparticle.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "client_id": "your_client_id",
  "client_secret": "your_client_secret",
  "audience": "https://api.mparticle.com",
  "grant_type": "client_credentials"
}
```

### Using your Bearer Token

A successful POST request to the token endpoint will result in a JSON response as follows:

~~~json
{
  "access_token": "YWIxMjdi883GHBBDnjsdKAJQxNjdjYUUJABbg6hdI.8V6HhxW-",
  "expires_in" : 28800,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
~~~

Subsequent requests to the Custom Access Roles API can now be authorized by setting the authorization header as follows:

`Authorization: Bearer YWIxMjdi883GHBBDnjsdKAJQxNjdjYUUJABbg6hdI.8V6HhxW-`

<aside>Tokens cannot be revoked, but they will expire every 8 hours. The initial token request can take between 1 and 3 seconds, so it is recommended that you cache the token and refresh it only when necessary.</aside>

## Custom role manifest and tasks

All mParticle custom roles are stored in a JSON custom role manifest. This manifest contains a list of roles, and each role includes a description, name, role ID, and a list of tasks.

A task is a unit of access to mParticle features. Some tasks offer full access and others provide view only access. The tasks detailed in the permissions reference below can be mixed and matched to define the custom role experience provided to users.

To create, modify, or delete a custom role, first retrieve a copy of your current manifest by submitting a GET request to `/platform/v2/organizations/{orgId:int}/accounts/{accountId:int}/roles`.

Modify the returned manifest to reflect the changes you want to make. For example, to delete a custom role, delete the corresponding JSON object for that role from your manifest. Finally, upload the edited manifest to `/platform/v2/organizations/{orgId:int}/accounts/{accountId:int}/roles` using a PUT request.

Custom roles are visible across an entire mParticle organization, even though the account ID must be included in calls to the Custom Roles API.

When creating a new role, a new role ID is generated and assigned to a role after a successful upload. If you are modifying an existing role, make sure the `role_id` in the new manifests matches the `role_id` of the corresponding role in the old manifest. Otherwise a new `role_id` will create a new role.

<aside class="warning">
Your custom role manifest must contain the full JSON object for every role you want included for your organization. When adding or modifying a single role, the manifest you upload should contain every preexisting role even though they are not being changed.

Remember that by uploading a new manifest, you are completely replacing the previous version. Omitting a preexisting role from the new manifest will result in an error if the role is actively assigned to a user or deleting the role if it's unassigned.
</aside>

The `user:core` permission is included with every custom role object in your manifest. This permission is necessary for users to be able to log in and view the mParticle dashboard in addition to other basic tasks.
